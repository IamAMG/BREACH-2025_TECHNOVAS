# AI- Driven Fraud Prevention

Background: 
Financial institutions face growing challenges with sophisticated fraud attempts, identity theft, 
and regulatory compliance requirements. Traditional fraud detection systems often struggle with 
false positives, delayed detection, and inadequate identity verification, resulting in significant 
financial losses and damaged customer trust. 

Description: 
Build an AI-driven platform combining secure digital identity verification (biometrics, 
blockchain-based IDs) with advanced fraud detection capabilities. Your solution must detect 
suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent identity theft, transactional fraud, insider trading, 
and ensure compliance with KYC/AML regulations.
